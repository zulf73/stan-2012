\title{Emergency Message To Stanford Mathematics}

\maketitle

Stanford Mathematics, I am Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed.  Bill Gates, the Microsoft Founder is attempting to establish using various illegitimate powers the principle that non-white people should not be given any tenure or high level position at all in America.  

I will attach some problems I had been doing from your Spring 2012 Analysis Qualifications for private interest.  I am 49 now, and I am firmly habituated to Princeton Honor Code.  My advisor at Princeton for thesis in 1995 was Jeff McNeal who I think is the chair of Ohio State Mathematics now.

I am a man of Great Conscience and believe that you ought to immediately inform all universities of the world that (a) Bill Gates is a racial {\em murderer}, and (b) that racial biases have no place in tenure process in any university in any continent of the world. I want you to exhibit some active leadership on this issue immediately as it is a global emergency and might affect billions of people.
